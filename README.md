## Code for "A biophysical model and network analysis of invertebrate community dispersal reveals regional patterns of seagrass habitat connectivity"

Citation: *pending*

This paper analyzes the functional connectivity of seagrass habitat by simulating the dispersal of an eelgrass-associated invertebrate community.

The code provided is not meant to be a stand alone functioning package. The directory structure is simplified so that the overall workflow is more easily interpretable, but it does not reflect the structure needed to run the simulations. 

Certain datasets are witheld due to size contraints or data sharing restrictions:
	* The seagrass dataset is compiled from multiple government and non-governmental sources. While most of the data is publically available, there are a couple of datasets that require a data sharing agreement.
	* The SalishSeaCast hydrodynamic data is not included in the repository, but it is publically avaialable here:
		* https://salishsea.eos.ubc.ca/erddap/index.html
	* The Opendrift raw output files are not included due to their size (~2TB).
